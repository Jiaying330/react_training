# Homework 7
## 1. What is FLUX?
Flux is an architectural pattern for managing the flow of data in web applications, 
emphasizing an unidirectional data flow. it involves a central store that holds the 
application's state, and actions that describe changes to this state. These actions are
dispatched to the store via a dispatcher, which then updates the state and triggers views
to re-render based on the new state. 
## 2. What is Redux? How do you use it with React components?
Redux is a global state management library. It is often used with React to manage the 
application's state in a centralized manner. Redux operates on the principles of a single
source of truth, immutability, and unidirectional data flow. In Redux, the application's
state is stored in a single immutable store, and changes to the state are made through
actions that describe what happened. These actions are processed by pure functions called 
reducers, which return a new state based on the action.

To use Redux with React components, you typicaly wrap the application in a Provider component
from react-redux, which makes the Redux store available throughout the component tree. React
components then use useSelector to access specific parts of the state and useDispatch to 
dispatch actions that modify the state
## 3. What is a reducer?
A reducer is a pure function in Redux that determines how the state of an application should
change in response to a specific action. It takes the current state and an action as its arguments
and returns a new state based on the action's type and payload, without mutating the original state.
## 4. How do you choose between ContextAPI and Redux for global state management?
Context API is better for simpler state management needs, where you need to share state
across a few components or when the state is relatively static. It is easier to use and lightweight
since it is built into React. However, for larger applications with more complex state logic, frequent
updates, or need for advanced features like middleware, Redux would be a better choice. Redux
provides a more structured approach to state management.
## 5. What is redux thunk and why do you want to use it?
Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return
a function instead of an action object. This function can be used to perform asynchronous
operations such as fetching data from APIs before dispatching an action to the reducers. 
You would want to use Redux Thunk to handle side effects in Redux application, which enables
you to manage async logic within action creators while keeping the components clean and focused
on UI logic.
