## 1. What are some differences between class and functional components?
While both class an functional components can achieve the same results, functional
components with the addition to hooks since 16.8 offer a simpler and more powerful
way to write React applications. For example, in class components, developers need to
use life cycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate to alter different
behaviors of the component. In functional components, similar effect can be achieved
by using hooks and offers simpler syntax and structure.
## 2. Explain what lifecycle is in a simple way. How do you manage it in class and functional components?
The lifecycle of a component refers to the series of stages it goes through from its 
creation to its removal from the DOM. This includes mounting, which describe when the 
component is first being created and inserted into the DOM; Updating refers to the 
component being re-rendered due to changes in props or state; Unmounting is when the 
component is being removed fromo the DOM.
## 3. Explain immutability in one sentence.
Immutability refers to the concept where an object's state cannot be modified after its
initialization.
